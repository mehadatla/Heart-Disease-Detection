# Heart Disease

## Abstract

Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in Americans. The only way to prevent these deaths is through early detection and for an average citizen to access such screening could cost up to $3000. Using AI we were able to build a Random Forests model that detects the possibility of having heart disease. Based on the results from our model, individuals could reach out for treatment and be less susceptible to facing the consequences of heart disease. Our model used numerous factors such as Sex, Age, Skin Cancer, Kidney Disease, Stroke, Physical Health, Diabetes, General Health, Difficulty Walking, Smoking, BMI, Mental Health, Race, Asthma, Physical Activity, Alcohol Drinking, and Sleep Time. Using these factors we were able to build a model with a 91.55% accuracy rate and detect races that were more likely to face death due to heart disease. We hope that this model can serve as a basis to alert people of heart disease and act as a tool for those who don't have access to professional screening.
